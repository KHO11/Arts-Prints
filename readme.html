# Arts and pint online 

Its the same project as arts and pints online but contains more in-depth code which includes PHP and more html implemented to make the design of the website to what I want it to be. 
Also used CMS in wordpress to create the site. 

# Lessons learned

This project was the first time I was using a new programming language to implement it in PHP. Was able to add new details, information and make changes to the website without the need to use elementor to manually add and delete stuff.

# Possible future features
When changes are applied to the website, it has to be adapatable and more responsive even on smaller devices such as mobile phones.

# Deployment
